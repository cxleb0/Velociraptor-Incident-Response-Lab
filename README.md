# Incident Response Walkthrough

This project documents an end-to-end incident response scenario I carried out using **Velociraptor**. The goal was to execute a complete incident response scenario, in response to 
a simulated malicious persistence attempt. 

---

## ðŸ›  Preparation  
- Set up and configured my lab environment with Velociraptor's Client-Server deployment.
- Hosted Velociraptor on my Ubuntu server.
- Deployed the client on a Kali Linux VM and connected it to the server.
- I captured screenshots of the Velociraptor admin panel and connected client list to show the baseline state before malicious activity.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Detection  
- To simulate an attack, I used the [MITRE ATT&CK technique **T1546.004**](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004/) â€“ persistence through malicious shell scripts.  
- Created a persistence mechanism by modifying the client's shell configuration file.
- Note: the persistance mechanism purely servers as a proof of concept. No real malware was created.

- From there, I ran an interrogation on the client to get some basic system information, then proceeded onto further analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis  
- Since I knew the persistence technique targeted shell configs, I searched for Velociraptor artifacts that would help me find the exact commands that were executed to establish persistence.
- Using Velociraptor, I ran the **Linux.Sys.BashHistory** artifact to collect shell history from the client.
- This revealed the commands used to establish persistence.

- Confirmed the attempts to establish persistence through the modification of the '.zshrc' file.


---

## ðŸ›¡ Containment  
- The next step I took was to contain the malicous activity.
- I quarantined the compromised host in Velociraptor.
- This will restrict all outbound communication and only allow it to communicate with the server.

  ![quarantined client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9260e19-6421-4675-8ff8-873e9de47d0b)
- Began investigating the host remotely using Velociraptor's vShell to inspect the modified .zshrc file.  
- Knowing that the .zshrc file was modified, I wanted to see what modifications were made, so I ran the command:
  ```bash
  cat /home/t0rment/.zshrc
  ```
- This revealed the persistence mechanism added to the file.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Eradication  
- To clean up the persistence mechanism, I removed the malicious entry from `.zshrc` using `sed`:  

```bash
sed -i '/touch \/tmp\/malware/d' /home/t0rment/.zshrc
```


![malware removal commands](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50e15e23-78df-4095-a6e5-068b62fdac3c)
- I then deleted leftover files created by the persistence mechanism:  
```bash
rm /tmp/malware
```

- Verified that the malicious entries were successfully removed.

---

## ðŸ”„ Recovery  
- To harden the system and prevent further modifications to the file, I applied the mitigation technique recommended by the 
  MITRE ATT&CK framework, to restrict file and directory permissions.
- Mitigation ID: M1022
- Made the .zshrc file immutable to block unauthorized modifications:
```bash
chattr +i /home/t0rment/.zshrc
```
![permision removal command](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/376647b8-ac40-4d0d-a568-417d47e162f0)
- Verified on client VM that making further modifications to .zshrc were blocked.

- With mitigations applied, the client was safely unquarantined and restored to normal operation.

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned  
- Reinforced the importance of visibility, speed, and repeatability in incident response. 
- Practiced the full incident response lifecycle by simulating a real-world MITRE ATT&CK technique and responding with Velociraptor.
- My next steps in a production environment would include establishing file integrity baselines to detect and prevent unauthorized modifications
  so an event like this doesn't happen again.
